# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to work as a team to create a web application that requires a user log in. As a team we brainstormed creative ideas for our web application that would easily allow us to implement the requiremtns for the project. Our project is a virtual community library that uses google books API, Bootstrap, Bcrypt, Node-geocoder, Node- Fetch, MySQL2, Express, Express-Handlebars, Dotenv, and Sequelize to create a fullly fucational website. As the creators we had to learn how to implement the frameworks and API used. In group projects dividing up the work and manging time is crucial for completion. 
# User Story
Our web application is a virtual community library. Any user can log in by creating an account. When creating an account the user must include their zip code in order to retrieve books from  libraries near them.  Once an account is created the user has access to a search bar, browse button, user dashboard, and homepage. Members of fully- booked have the option to create their own community libraries, separate from community libraries. By creating your own library the application gives the user options to update current libraries, add a books to a library, and delete books.

If a user does not want to create an account, they are still able to use the web application freely. However, they can not create a personalized library and enjoy the features that come along with that.
